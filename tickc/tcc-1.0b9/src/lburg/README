Some changes to the standard lburg that comes with lcc:

gram.y: 
	* lengthened BUFSIZ
	* moved declaration of yylineno to top of file, to avoid
	  "declaration before use" errors when running bison instead
	  of yacc
	* renamed TERM to TERMINAL to avoid clash of enum and #define
	  names when using bison (enum definitoin of TERM occurs in
	  lburg.h)
