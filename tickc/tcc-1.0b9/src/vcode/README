The vcode readme no longer really applies.

Bpp is autogenerated by the top-level tcc makefile.  ./bin no longer exists:
bpp now lives in ./bpp, and the mips version of m4 is in ./m4/m4.

Links to the appropriate make and config files are automatically created from
the build directory by the top-level tcc makefile.

The naming scheme for make and config files is now
	<cpu>-<os without version number>
ie, sparc-solaris, mips-irix, etc.  This makes it possible to install
everything automatically using autoconf and the top-level tcc makefile.

Confused?  Disgusted?  Send mail to maxp@lcs.mit.edu (July 11 1997).
