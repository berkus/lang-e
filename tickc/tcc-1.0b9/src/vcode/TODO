+ Modify calls so that they move their result into a register.

+ Make regress cover the instruction set.

+ Large activation records are not supported.

+ optimize absolute jumps to targets that immediately follow (is actually
  fairly easy).

+ make v_label destructive so that we can reuse linkage space.
  simple way: check if label is eqal to genlabel-1.  this will take
  care of if-stmts/loops.   this requires incremental linking,
  which forces us to make sure code is not moved (unless jumps are 
  relative, which they should be).
