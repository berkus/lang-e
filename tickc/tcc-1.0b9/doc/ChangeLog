1.0b5: 
       * much code and docs cleanup; icode bug fixes
1.0b6: 
       * fixed install: no longer depends on having '.' in PATH
1.0b7:
       * improved install (should be completely automatic now: no more
       fussing with config/sys/my-machine.c)
       * cleaned up vcode build (no more bpp binary in distribution,
       makefiles named by arch-os to allow automatic installation, etc.)
       * icode: float aggregates (arrays of floats, structs with floats
       in them) now work
       * added preliminary support for solaris (C-to-C mode still breaks
       because of problems with header files)
1.0b8:
       * finished solaris support
       * added support for SimpleScalar simulator
       * added vcode-x86 and preliminary x86 support (but rcc doesn't work
       yet)
       * added fast live variable analysis to icode
       * plenty of bug fixes and cleanup
1.0b9:
       * icode rewrite: it is now easier to extend and a little faster
       than before
       * added bpo, a programmable binary peephole optimizer (however, it
       currently only knows a few sparc-specific peephole rules)
       * moved common code for vcode, icode, and the run-time system into
       src/sup
       * better error checking/handling in front-end
       * fixed some install bugs
       * added benchmarks/tests (in tst/tcc2) and improved the
       benchmarking infrastructure
