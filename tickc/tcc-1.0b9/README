This is the distribution for tcc-1.0b9, a compiler for `C (Tick-C).


This software is based on lcc, a retargetable compiler for ANSI C described in
the book `A Retargetable C Compiler: Design and Implementation' (Benjamin
Cummings, 1995, ISBN 0-8053-1670-1).  The authors of lcc are Chris Fraser and
David Hanson.  See doc/original-lcc for information about the original lcc
compiler.

The vcode system is the work of Dawson Engler (the vcode used by tcc is derived
from his vcode 0.07).  vcode-x86 was written by Tom Pinckney.  The copt
peephole optimizer was written by Chris Fraser.

tcc is provided under the same conditions as lcc: it is available free for your
personal research and instructional use under the `fair use' provisions of the
copyright law.  See doc/original-lcc/COPYRIGHT.lcc for more information.
