Manifest:
	+ dcg.c  contains code to fab code on the fly to perform multiplication
of a matrix by an integer
	+ static.c performs this operation without DCG.
	+ booth-gen generates tables to perform strength-reduction
	+ mult.c uses these tables to strength-reduce constant multiplies upto 1024

To check output:
	static -n 8 -v
	dcg	-n 8 -v
To time:
	static -n 64 -t 3 -c 1024
	dcg -n 64 -t 3 -c 1024

-t controls the number of trials
-n controls the matrix size
-c determines the range of constants; will not work for more than 1024
