	+ dcg_calc is a simple compiling calculator.  
	+ calc is a simple interpreting calculator.
	+ test contains sample input.

To extend the DCG calculator to include iteration, variables, etc. it
is probably cleanest to first build up IR trees and then use vcode
to compile them.  It would be faster to compile using vcode directly,
but more clumsy since the resultant machine code would have to be copied 
to the correct place in the instruction stream.

BUG: / * % are not handled correctly on the sparc (the backend trashs
 	temporary registers during the function call to these routines).
