Before compilation copy either the pair:

	sparc-makefile -> makefile
	sparc-config.h -> vcode-config.h

Or
	mips-makefile -> makefile
	mips-config.h -> vcode-config.h

Or
	sgi-makefile -> makefile
	sgi-config.h -> vcode-config.h

Or

	alpha-makefile -> makefile
	alpha-config.h -> vcode-config.h

Depending on whether the target is a alpha, mips or sparc.  Then do
a `make clean', followed by a `make depend' and then `make'.
If the make process depends on ``bpp'', then you will have to 
manually recompile it (cd into ./bin/bpp to do this). 

Then make should compile everything.  A large regression test is
in ../tests.  Compile and run it to make sure that everything is
ok.  If the regression test fails it will print out disassembled
code; otherwise it simply prints out a bunch of random numbers.

I haven't tried this source on an IRIX.  

`grep define vcode-macros` will give all vcode macros for
generating code.  these macros are a subset of those described
in the tutorial.
